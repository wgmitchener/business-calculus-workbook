\Section{Absolute extrema with logarithms}

Consider the function
\begin{equation*}
 f(x) = \LN{1 + x} - x^2
\end{equation*}
Suppose the domain of $f$ is restricted to the closed interval $[0,2]$.

\begin{ProblemSet}[pencil space=2in]
 \begin{Problem}
  What is $f'(x)$?
 \end{Problem}
 \begin{Problem}
  What are the critical numbers of $f$?
 \end{Problem}
 \begin{Problem}[pencil space=1.25in]
  What is the absolute minimum value of $f$, and at what $x$-value does it occur?
  What is the absolute maximum value of $f$, and at what $x$-value does it occur?
 \end{Problem}
 \begin{Problem}[pencil space=1.25in]
  What if the domain of $f$ is $[-\nicefrac{1}{2},1]$ instead?
 \end{Problem}
\end{ProblemSet}
