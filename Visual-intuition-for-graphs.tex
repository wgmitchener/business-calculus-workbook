\Section{Visual intuition for graphs}

In each pair of grids, the upper grid shows the graph of $y = f(x)$.
Sketch the graph of $y = f'(x)$ on the grid below it.
Hint: Think about critical numbers.

In each pair of grids, the lower grid shows the graph of $y = f'(x)$.
Sketch a possible graph of $y = f(x)$ on the grid above it, assuming $f(0) = 0$.
Hint: Think about critical numbers.
