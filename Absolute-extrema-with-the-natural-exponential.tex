\Section{Absolute extrema with the natural exponential}

Consider the function
\begin{equation*}
 f(x) = 2x^2 \me^{-\nicefrac{x}{4}}
\end{equation*}
Suppose the domain of $f$ is restricted to the closed interval $[-1,10]$.

\begin{ProblemSet}[pencil space=2in]
 \begin{Problem}
  What is $f'(x)$?
 \end{Problem}
 \begin{Problem}
  What are the critical numbers of $f$?
 \end{Problem}
 \begin{Problem}[pencil space=1.25in]
  What is the absolute minimum value of $f$, and at what $x$-value does it occur?
  What is the absolute maximum value of $f$, and at what $x$-value does it occur?
 \end{Problem}
 \begin{Problem}[pencil space=1.25in]
  What if the domain of $f$ is $[1,4]$ instead?
 \end{Problem}
\end{ProblemSet}
