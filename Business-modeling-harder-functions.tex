Consider the following scenario.
Cougar Caf\'e sells cookies.
Based on past sales figures, the manager estimates that to sell $x$ packs of cookies, the price of a pack of cookies should be
\begin{equation*}
 55 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0.02 x} \text{ dollars }
\end{equation*}
The cost to make $x$ packs of cookies is
\begin{equation*}
 4 + 3.50 x + 0.04 x^2 \text{ dollars }
\end{equation*}
