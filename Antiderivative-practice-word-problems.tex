 \begin{Problem}
  A distributor buys bleach from a factory for $\$0.25$ per liter plus a flat $\$700$ delivery fee, and it arrives in one big shipment of $x$ liters.
  It costs $\$0.02$ per liter per day to store the bleach (rent, maintenance, etc).
  The distributor sells the bleach at a rate of $120$ liters per day.
  How much does it cost the distributor to buy and store $x$ liters of bleach until it's all sold?
