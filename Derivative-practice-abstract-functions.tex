\Section{Derivative practice---abstract functions}

In each of these problems, one function is defined in terms of another function.
The other function is not defined, so the final answer will include references to this other function or its derivative.
For clarity, Lagrange notation, as in $f(x)$, is used throughout.
A letter followed by an expression in parentheses, as in $f(x)$ or $w(t)$ will always mean function application, not multiplication.
Multiplication is always indicated by a dot $\cdot$ on this problem set.

\begin{ProblemSet}[pencil space=2.5in]

 \begin{Problem}
  What is $f'(x)$?
  Here, $g$ is a function.
  Your final answer will have $g$ and $g'$ in it.
  \begin{equation*}
   f(x) = x^2 \cdot g(x)
  \end{equation*}
 \end{Problem}

 \begin{Problem}[pencil space=3in]
  What is $g'(t)$?
  Here, $w$ is a function.
  Your final answer will have $w$ and $w'$ in it.
  \begin{equation*}
   g(t) = \frac{w(t) + t^2}{w(t) - t^2}
  \end{equation*}
 \end{Problem}

 \begin{Problem}
  What is $f'(x)$?
  Here, $m$ is a function.
  Your answer will $m'$ in it.
  \begin{equation*}
   f(x) = m\!\left(3\cdot x^2 + 7\right)
  \end{equation*}
 \end{Problem}

 \begin{Problem}
  What is $f'(x)$?
  Here, $q$ is a function.
  Your answer will have $q$ and $q'$ in it.
  \begin{equation*}
   f(x) = (10 + q(3\cdot x))^5
  \end{equation*}
 \end{Problem}

\end{ProblemSet}
