## Files from TLT Con 2023

In May of 2023, I gave a presentation at [TLT Con](https://tlt.cofc.edu/tltcon.php), a teaching, learning, and technology conference offered virtually by the [College of Charleston](http://www.cofc.edu).
A Google Drive with files from that presentation is available
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rGUfciwGg7H2UMMFgH9kSeVlJZnz3Nho?usp=sharing) and
